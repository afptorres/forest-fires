# Forest Fires
Project developed in the context of the course: Data Mining I. 
The goal was to build a Machine Learning model to predict if a forest fire was intentional (or not).
The data used comprises observations based on fires occured in Portugal between the years 2014 and 2015.

## Motivation

## Problem

## Task 1: Data Understanding and Preparation

## Task 2: Predictive Modelling

## Task 3: Kaggle Competition

## Results
The decision of the best model was based on the evaluation of the AUC_ROC metric. We achieved the higher result with random forest.
