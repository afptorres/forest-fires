# Forest Fires
Project developed in the context of the course: Data Mining I. 
The goal was to build a Machine Learning model to predict if a forest fire was intentional (or not).
The data used comprises observations based on fires occured in Portugal between the years 2014 and 2015.

## Motivation

## Problem

## Task 1: Data Understanding and Preparation

The notebooks 'data_preparation.nb.html' and 'data_understanding.nb.html' provide the code used to complete this task and its outputs.

In this task, we had to deal with some quality issues, like inconsistencies and missing values. We also created new features by fetching climate information, relating to temperature and wind.

Aditionally, we performed data transformation techniques.

We also provide some visualizations, useful for the understanding of the data.

## Task 2: Predictive Modelling

The notebook 'predictive_modelling.nb.html' provides the code used to complete this task and its outputs.




## Task 3: Kaggle Competition

The file 'deliverables/submission.csv' was produced to submit to the competition.

## Results

A presentation 'deliverables/presentation.ppt' was created to expand on some of the process and to explain the results achieved.

The decision of the best model was based on the evaluation of the AUC_ROC metric. We achieved the higher result with random forest.
